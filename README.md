### Description

- In the above Demo, we first confirm that both parties have ballance of Rs 10,000 and Rs 10,000 each. 
- Then we proceed to add 10,000 through a simulated bank server to the user1.
- Then move to Postman to simulate bank confirmation of the money transfer.
- We confirm that 10,000 has successfully added to user1.
- Then we proceed to test p2p transfer of money.
- We transfer Rs 1,000 from user1 to user2.
- The transfer of funds is confirmed by the recent transactions in user1's window.
- We can observe change in balance in both the parties which is the result of a successful transfer.
